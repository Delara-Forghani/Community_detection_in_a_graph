# Community_detection_in_a_graph

In this program it is tried to detect communities in graphs via an algorithm in which all the edges in the graph rates up and 
in each step of the algorithm the edge with the least score is omitted . 
The algorithm terminates when the graph is divided into two parts . Each part involves the commiunities of the graph .
